                    <p>At Tutor.com, we believe that every student deserves a personal tutor, and we are dedicated to promoting equity, opportunity, and achievement for all learners. To that end, we partner with colleges and universities, K–12 schools and districts, public and state libraries, employee benefits programs, and the U.S. military to provide 24/7, on-demand, 1-to-1 tutoring and homework help in more than 250 subjects.</p>
                    <p> We do this by providing encouraging, empowering, and effective academic and professional support for learners of all ages and stages—from kindergarten through college, graduate school, career, and continuing education.</p>

                    <p>In 2000, Tutor.com, Inc. was incorporated and began partnering with institutions to ensure that students from all socioeconomic backgrounds would have access to highly effective 1-to-1 tutoring and homework help, day or night, from any Internet-enabled device.</p>
                    <p>In 2014, Tutor.com acquired The Princeton Review®, a world leader in education services, and added The Princeton Review test preparation services to its online tutoring platform and offerings. Today, we work with thousands of educational institutions and education-forward organizations, as well as the U.S. Department of Defense and Coast Guard Mutual Assistance, to deliver nearly two million tutoring, homework help, and test preparation sessions per year.</p>

                    <p>ach year, Tutor.com receives more than 100,000 applications from prospective tutors. Applicants must demonstrate their subject-matter expertise, effective tutoring methodology, mastery of our online environment, and understanding of Tutor.com’s pedagogy and policies. Those able to satisfy the arduous application process must also pass a thorough third-party background check. On average, just 1.2 percent of those who begin the process are ultimately onboarded as Tutor.com tutors. Through our supportive quality-assurance program, Tutor.com ensures that our tutors consistently provide highly effective, customized, and engaging instruction and support.</p>

                    <p>
                        Over more than two decades of supporting students, educators, school leaders, and families, we have helped institutions increase student pass and persistence rates, and learners become more confident in their schoolwork. Our learner satisfaction rates remain consistently high: 97 percent of post-session survey respondents would recommend Tutor.com to a friend, and 98 percent are glad their institution offers Tutor.com. The feeling is mutual. We are honored to partner with institutions and organizations to help them scale the human connection and provide individualized support—anytime, anywhere.
